        /*
        Complete Data structure and algorithm


        Data structure:
        they way to organize data
        after organizing it becomes easy to prcess

        types of DS are :
        linear :  sequential order and its single level
              array, linked list ,queue stack
        Non Linear :  Its stores data in multilevel
              tree and graph

       Algorithm :'set of instruction to perform

       Analysis of Algorithm:
         -> time complexity
         -> space complexity

       Asymptotic analysis of algorithm :

       it help to analyse the performance of the algorithm based on input size

       Asymptotic notation:
        3 notations
        ->Big O
        ->theta
        ->omega


        omega notation -> lower bound
        -> present best case of algo
        ex: the code execute in 100 sec then it will take more than 100 sec but not less than that

        Big O notation: upper bound
        -> presents the worst case of algo
        ex :the code execute in 100 sec then it will take less than 100 sec like 90 sec or 70 sec but not more than that


         theta notation: average of upper bound and lower bound
         -> presents the average case of algo
         ex :code execute in 100 sec then it can take 90 sec , 110sec or 120 sec for each execution the avg is taken
